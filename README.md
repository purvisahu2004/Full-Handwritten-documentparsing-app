Handwritten Document extraction and digitization using AI 
Build an AI-based system to extract data from handwritten documents and convert it into structured digital formats.

The system processes multiple scanned forms, extracts key fields using a vision-language model, normalizes the data, displays it in a tabular UI, and exports it to Excel for business use.

This project helped me understand OCR pipelines, AI integration, data normalization, and cloud deployment constraints.
